                <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Antonella! Currently, I'm a student at Thomas A. Edison CTE in NYC, where I'm pursuing AP Literature and Composition, AP Computer Science Principles, and engaging in Programming and Prototyping coursework. As an active board member of the Green Thumb Society, I'm deeply involved in extracurricular activities. I am a Tech Flex Leader Alumni at America On Tech, Inc. in LA, NYC, and Miami, where I participated in a rigorous year-long web development and Product Management program. Through this experience, I attended weekly sessions, completed 80+ hours of coding training, and developed a robust portfolio of technology projects showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Prior to that, I excelled as a TECH360 Summer Boot Camp student, gaining technical coding skills and presenting a final group project during Demo Day Competition. My dedication to learning and my proficiency in various technical skills, such as Google Docs/Slides and Python, have earned me recognition, including completion of the CS4ALL 2023 Hackathon and graduation from the TECH360 and TFL.

                <p>This year's reflection: Throughout this school year in my programming and prototyping class, I've experienced significant personal and academic growth. One proud moment was successfully developing my animation, showcasing my ability to apply creative knowledge practically. I faced challenges, such as debugging but through patience and persistence, I overcame them. Projects with creating games captured my interest, providing practical experience. I notably improved my object-oriented programming skills through practice and experimentation. Contributing to our classroom community, I actively participated in discussions, shared resources, and led coding workshops. Collaborating with classmates enriched my learning experience, teaching me the value of teamwork and effective communication. A standout group project involved developing an app for the InfyApp Challenge created by Infosys that addressed the challenges of education around the world. Looking forward, I aim to deepen my Python knowledge, explore advanced topics, and pursue internship opportunities. I'm also interested in learning web development frameworks like Replit and Github to expand my skill set. My advice to myself would be to embrace challenges and continue seeking mentorship and collaboration opportunities. Overall, this year has been a journey of growth, that will shape my future challenges in programming and beyond.</p>
